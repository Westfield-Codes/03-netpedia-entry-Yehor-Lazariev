  <h4>What happens to your online accounts after you pass away?</h4>
  <h2>Definition / Description</h2>
  <p>When a person passes away, their online accounts often remain active for a period of time. Social media, emails, and cloud storage can hold valuable data or become abandoned accounts. It’s important to understand how these accounts are managed after death.</p>

  <h2>Examples</h2>
  <p><strong>Social Media Accounts</strong> are often memorialized after a person dies. For example, Facebook allows a user’s profile to be turned into a "memorialized" account, which friends and family can visit but not interact with.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Email & Cloud Accounts</strong> may remain active until someone takes action. Email providers like Google offer tools that can notify a trusted person or automatically delete an account after a period of inactivity.</p>
  
  <h2>How to Manage Your Accounts After Death?</h2>
  <p>To prevent confusion and ensure your accounts are handled properly, you should plan ahead:</p>

  <p><strong>Memorialization:</strong> Some social media platforms, like Facebook, allow you to set up a trusted person to manage your profile after you pass away. This helps keep your account as a tribute for your loved ones.</p>

  <p><strong>Account Access:</strong> Make sure your family or trusted friends know how to access your important online accounts, like email and cloud storage. Some services allow you to share access in case of an emergency.</p>

  <p><strong>Account Deletion:</strong> If you prefer that your accounts are deleted after death, you can arrange this with most email providers or social media platforms. Some services even allow you to set this up in advance.</p>
